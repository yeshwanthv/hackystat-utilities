#summary Description and instructions for downloading, and using a UriCache library in your code.
#labels Featured

= 1.0 Introduction =

This User Guide provides instructions on how to download, install, configure, and use the Hackystat !UriCache library. It also provides simple examples of library usage.

The !UriCache system is a wrapper around the [http://jakarta.apache.org/jcs/ Apache JCS] system. It is designed to provide an API well suited to the needs of Hackystat services. 

!UriCache is a memory cache which is backed by an indexed disk cache.  !UriCache will expire items from the cache according to two techniques. 

 * If the user specifies an expiration time when adding an item, the item will be removed soon after this expiration time is reached. By default, items expire 24 hours after being added.

 * If the maximum cache capacity is reached, then items are removed according to a least recently used algorithm. 

The principles for this cache have been discussed in the following thread: [http://groups.google.com/group/hackystat-dev/msg/9379f301b9db710b "RFC: Caching"].


The !UriCache uses a background memory shrinker which runs every 60 seconds to delete items which are expired. This shrinker is not yet fully functional.

= 2.0 Downloading =

You will normally want to download the latest distribution of the !UriCache with others !HackyStat utilities from the [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-utilities/downloads/list Downloads] page. The file will be named hackystat-utilities-{version}.zip. Inside the archive you will find a uricache.lib.jar file which is the !UriCache library.

It is also possible to download the sources from the [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-utilities/source Hackystat-Utilities SVN repository], but in that case you will need to build the library from sources. The distribution package comes with both sources and a pre-built libraries.

= 3.0 Prerequisites =

If you wish to build the UriCache system from sources, you will need to install the following packages, environment variables, and Eclipse classpath variables as follows:

|| *Package* || *Version* || *Environment/Classpath Variable* || *Sample Env Value* ||
|| [http://commons.apache.org/logging/ Apache Commons Logging] || 1.1 ||APACHE_COMMONS_LOGGING_HOME || c:\tools\commons-logging-1.1 ||
|| [http://jakarta.apache.org/jcs/ Apache Java Caching System] || 1.3 || APACHE_JCS_HOME || c:\tools\apache-jcs-1.3 ||

!UriCache also uses the util.concurrent Release 1.3.4. by [http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl Doug Lea] which is included within the !UriCache package.

= 4.0 Usage =

In order to use !UriCache library in your code, you must have uricache.lib.jar in your classpath at both build and run time.

== 4.1. Configuring !UriCacheProperties == 
Before obtaining the !UriCache instance you need to configure cache properties first. Upon instantiation of !UriCacheProperties next parameters set to their default values:
|| !UriCache property || Default property value || Method to set the custom value ||
|| cacheRegionName || "!UriCache" || setCacheRegionName(String cacheName) ||
|| maxIdleTime || 86400 ms, i.e. 24 hours|| setMaxIdleTime(Long idleTime) ||
|| maxMemoryCacheCapacity || 10000 items || setMaxMemoryCacpacity(Long maxMemoryCacheCapacity) ||
|| cacheStoragePath || current system TEMP folder || setCacheStoragePath(String storagePath) ||
|| loggerLevel || Level.OFF || setLoggerLevel(Level level) ||
Basically the default !UriCacheProperties instance might be used for most of the cache instances you need.

You also can find additional information at the [http://hackystat-utilities.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/org/hackystat/utilities/uricache/UriCacheProperties.html UriCacheProperties Javadoc page]

== 4.2. Getting cache instance ==

Use the default constructors to get !UriCacheProperties and !UriCache instance:
{{{
   UriCacheProperties prop = new UriCacheProperties();
   UriCache myURICache<String, String> = new UriCache<String, String>();
}}}

If you are going to create multiple caches in your code don't forget to assign different names to each of those, for example:

{{{
    // create three properties first
    UriCacheProperties stringCacheProp = new UriCacheProperties();
    stringCacheProp.setCacheStoragePath("sandbox/cache");
    stringCacheProp.setCacheRegionName("StringsCache");

    UriCacheProperties intCacheProp = new UriCacheProperties();
    intCacheProp.setCacheStoragePath("sandbox/cache");
    intCacheProp.setCacheRegionName("IntegerCache");

    UriCacheProperties doubleCacheProp = new UriCacheProperties();
    doubleCacheProp.setCacheStoragePath("sandbox/cache");
    doubleCacheProp.setCacheRegionName("DoubleCache");

    try {
      // create cache instances
      UriCache<String, String> stringCache = new UriCache<String, String>(stringCacheProp);
      UriCache<String, Integer> integerCache = new UriCache<String, Integer>(intCacheProp);
      UriCache<String, Double> doubleCache = new UriCache<String, Double>(doubleCacheProp);
    }
    catch (UriCacheException e) {
      fail("Unable to proceed with cache instantiation: "
          + formatter.format(new LogRecord(Level.ALL, e.toString())));
    }

}}}

== 4.3. Caching an item ==

To cache an item you may use two methods:

  `cache(K uriString, V obj)` - this methods caches the item using first parameter as the key.

  `cache(K uriString, V obj, XMLGregorianCalendar expirationTime)` - this method caches an item and specifies its expiration time.

== 4.4. Retrieving items from the cache ==

To check an item presence within the cache and retrieve it `lookup(K uriString)` method used. It returns item if it was found within the cache or `null` if it wasn't.

== 4.5. Removing object from cache == 

To remove an item from cache `remove(K uriString)` method might be used.

You may use a `clear()` method to purge the whole cache.

== 4.6. Automatically purging the cache items by memory idle time ==

To specify a time interval value for the automatic cache purging the `setMaxMemoryIdleTimeSeconds(int seconds)` method used. !UriCache will actively free the memory used by the items if this memory wasn't read within the time interval specified.

== 4.7. Shutting down the cache ==

While I am still working on the persistence, the `shutdown()` does not works the way you may think, it's actually purges all memory items to the disk cache and closes the file access. Therefore you might find huge files left after testing. To handle this issue it's recommended to call two methods consequently to shut down cache:
{{{
    myUriCache.clear();     // removes all items from the cache
    myUriCache.shutdown();  // closes the cache 
}}}

You may want see [http://hackystat-utilities.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/org/hackystat/utilities/uricache/UriCache.html UriCache JavaDocs] for additional information.
